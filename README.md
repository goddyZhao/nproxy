A cli proxy tool specialized in file replacing

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/goddyZhao/nproxy.png)](http://travis-ci.org/goddyZhao/nproxy)

## Why NProxy

Maybe you have such question as why NProxy when we have [Fiddler](http://www.fiddler2.com/fiddler2/), [Charles](http://www.charlesproxy.com/), [Rythem](http://www.alloyteam.com/2012/05/web-front-end-tool-rythem-1/) and [Tinyproxy](https://banu.com/tinyproxy/). Yes, there is no doubt that they are all great tools, however they don't meet my requirements:

* Support Mac, Linux and Windows(especially Mac and Linux)
* Support replacing combo files with separated source files
* Support directory mapping

This is the main reason why NProxy is here. Besides, NProxy can improve the efficiency of my daily development for enterprise-level product with a bunch of complex building processes, which cost me lots of time.

I've written a post named [NProxy: The Mjolnir for UI Developers](http://en.blog.goddyzhao.me/post/29470818841/nproxy-the-mjolnir-for-ui-developers)  and a keynote [NProxy: A Sharp Weapon for UI Developers](https://speakerdeck.com/u/goddyzhao/p/nproxy-a-sharp-weapon-for-ui-developers) to explain my reason for developing NProxy in detail.

## Features

* Support Mac, Linux and Windows  
* Support both single file and combo file replacing
* Support directory mapping with any files
* Support both HTTP and HTTPS

## Installation

    npm install -g nproxy (node >= v0.8.x is required)

If you are not familiar with Node.js and NPM, you can visit the [How to install NProxy](https://github.com/goddyZhao/nproxy/wiki/How-to-install-NProxys) wiki page to get detail information about installation of NProxy

## Template of Replace Rule file(should be a .js file)

    module.exports = [

      // 1. replace single file with local one
      {
        pattern: 'homepage.js',      // Match url you wanna replace
        responder:  "/home/goddyzhao/workspace/homepage.js"
      },

      // 2. replace single file with web file
      {
        pattern: 'homepage.js',      // Match url you wanna replace
        responder:  "http://www.anotherwebsite.com/assets/js/homepage2.js"
      },

      // 3. replace combo file with src with absolute file path
      {
        pattern: 'group/homepageTileFramework.*.js', 
        responder: [
          '/home/goddyzhao/workspace/webapp/ui/homepage/js/a.js',
          '/home/goddyzhao/workspace/webapp/ui/homepage/js/b.js',
          '/home/goddyzhao/workspace/webapp/ui/homepage/js/c.js'
        ] 
      },

      // 4. replace combo file with src with relative file path and specified dir
      {
        pattern: 'group/homepageTileFramework.*.js',
        responder: {
          dir: '/home/goddyzhao/workspace/webapp/ui/homepage/js',
          src: [
            'a.js',
            'b.js',
            'c.js'
          ]
        }
      },

      // 5. Map server image directory to local image directory
      {
        pattern: 'ui/homepage/img',  // must be a string
        responder: '/home/goddyzhao/image/' //must be a absolute directory path
      },

      // 6. Write responder with regular expression variables like $1, $2
      {
        pattern: /https?:\/\/[\w\.]*(?::\d+)?\/ui\/(.*)_dev\.(\w+)/,
        responder: 'http://localhost/proxy/$1.$2'
      }
    ];

You can use the [template file](https://github.com/goddyzhao/nproxy/blob/master/replace-rule.sample.js) and replace it with your own configurations. 

## Quickly setup rule files for SF project

For UI Developers from SuccessFactors, here is a bonus for you guys. You can use the [sf-transfer](http://goddyzhao.github.com/sf-transfer) tool to transfer the combo xml file to NProxy rule file automatically!
